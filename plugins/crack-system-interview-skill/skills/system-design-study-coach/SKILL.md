# System Design Study Coach

Use this skill to supervise the bundled 14-week system design and algorithms plan.

## Quick Workflow

1. Resolve the day:
   - If the user gives `Week N Day M`, use that.
   - If the user gives a date, use that.
   - If the user says "today", run the lookup script without week/day; if there is no matching date, ask for the desired week/day.
2. Run:

```bash
python3 system-design-study-coach/scripts/plan_lookup.py --week N --day M
```

From inside the plugin copy, use:

```bash
python3 plugins/crack-system-interview-skill/skills/system-design-study-coach/scripts/plan_lookup.py --week N --day M
```

3. Return the day's assignment in Chinese unless the user requests another language.
4. Keep the response action-oriented:
   - 学习源包
   - 今日产出物
   - 必须掌握
   - 修复规则
   - 算法三题
   - 选做题
   - 打卡问题

## Supervision Loop

Use this loop for daily coaching:

```text
assign -> user attempt -> rubric check -> repair -> record next action
```

Do not treat reading as completion. Completion requires the user to produce the artifact in the daily rubric and answer the check-out questions.

## Check-In

Ask for one compact status:

```text
今天能投入多少时间？是否要压缩系统设计、算法，还是两者都做？
```

Then adapt the assignment:

- Full day: keep all source links, one artifact, 3 required algorithms.
- 60-90 minutes: one source link, one artifact, 1-2 algorithms.
- 30 minutes: one source link, one verbal artifact, no optional problems.

## Check-Out

Use the page rubric. Ask the user to provide:

- 产出物：白板/文字/口述摘要
- 三个必须掌握点
- 今天最不稳的一个点
- 算法题结果和错因

If the user misses a required point, create a repair task:

```text
Repair:
- Rewrite the missing path or schema.
- Explain the tradeoff in 90 seconds.
- Redo one related problem or deep dive.
```

## Combining With Other Skills

Use `$card` when the user wants a visual explanation of a daily source, concept, or problem breakdown.

Use `$senior-sde-interview-script` when the user wants a polished, interview-ready spoken answer or mock answer for the day's system design topic.

The printable pages live under `docs/`. The GitHub Pages root is expected to be:

```text

```

Use `--base-url https://danielwanwx.github.io/crack-system-interview-skill` with `plan_lookup.py` when returning public links.
